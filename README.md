# NPC RP Gossip Text Re-enabler
An addon for World of Warcraft Dragonflight, WotLK Classic and Classic Era!


## About
This addon will show some hidden dialog for NPCs, which by default is not shown to players if there is only a single dialog option to select e.g. Auctioneers.
Ideal for roleplayers and Immersion!


## Compatibility

* *Dragonflight* - 10.0.5
* *WotLK Classic* - 3.4.1
* *Classic Era* - 1.14.3


## Installation
Download the latest version from one of the places below, and unzip it in your `<warcraft>\<_version_>\Interface\Addons` folder if installing manually.

* [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/npc-rp-gossip)
* [WoWInterface](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25707-NPCRPGossipTextRe-enabler.html)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/NinerBull/NPCRPGossip/releases/latest)
* Or put `https://github.com/NinerBull/NPCRPGossip` into your favourite Addon Manager


## Configuration

You can toggle on-and-off by using the command `/npcrpgossip` in chat.

Holding down the *SHIFT* key before interacting with an NPC will now temporarily disable/enable the RP Gossip, depending whether you have toggled gossip on or off using the command above.


## Notes

Inspired by Humbugged's thread on MMO-Champ: http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1467297-NPC-RP-text!-How-to-enable - only this addon enables the Gossip text upon login.

Note: Not all NPCs have gossip text, and will still go straight to the vendor tab anyway.
