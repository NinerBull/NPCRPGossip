# NPC RP Gossip Text Re-enabler [Retail Version]
This addon will show some hidden dialog for NPCs, which by default is not shown to players if there is only a single dialog option to select e.g. Auctioneers.
Ideal for roleplayers and Immersion!

<ul><li>You can toggle on-and-off by using the command /npcrpgossip</li>
<li>Holding down the SHIFT key before interacting with an NPC will now temporarily disable/enable the RP Gossip, depending whether you have toggled gossip on or off using the command above.</li></ul>

Inspired by Humbugged's thread on MMO-Champ: http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1467297-NPC-RP-text!-How-to-enable - only this addon enables the Gossip text upon login.

Note: Not all NPCs have gossip text, and will still go straight to the vendor tab anyway.
